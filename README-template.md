Got it — you want **a simple “What I Learned” section** that you can copy–paste into your Frontend Mentor README **based on the CSS you wrote**.

Here is the perfect text for it 👇 (clean, simple, student-friendly, and exactly matching your project).

# ✅ What I Learned (Final Text to Copy)

While building this project, I learned several important concepts in HTML and CSS:

### **1. How to use Flexbox and Grid together**

I used **CSS Grid** for the main layout and **Flexbox** inside smaller sections.
Grid helped me switch between **one-column (mobile)** and **two-column (desktop)** layouts easily.

### **2. How to make a fully responsive layout**

I learned how to use media queries to change the design when the screen becomes larger:

```css
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  /* desktop styles */
}
```

This helped me move from a centered mobile layout to a side-by-side desktop layout.

### **3. How to use background images for mobile vs desktop**

I practiced applying different background images depending on screen size:

* Mobile → `bg-mobile.svg`
* Desktop → `bg-desktop.svg`

And learned how background-position and background-size affect the design.

### **4. How to style text and spacing cleanly**

I improved my understanding of:

* font sizes
* line spacing
* margins
* centering text
* creating vertical rhythm using `gap`

### **5. How to design a rounded button with shadow**

I learned how to make a soft, modern button style:

```css
.register {
  background: white;
  border-radius: 1.5rem;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
}
```

### **6. How to style social icons inside circles**

I practiced creating circle icons using:

```css
.color {
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: 2px solid white;
}
```

### **7. How to center items perfectly**

I used Flexbox to center items both vertically and horizontally:

```css
display: flex;
align-items: center;
justify-content: center;
```

This helped me keep images, text, buttons, and icons aligned properly.
